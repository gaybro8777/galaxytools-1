  deFuse - gene fusion discovery using RNA-Seq data

  deFuse is a software package for gene fusion discovery using RNA-Seq data. 
  The software uses clusters of discordant paired end alignments 
  to inform a split read alignment analysis for finding fusion boundaries.  
  The software also employs a number of heuristic filters in an attempt 
  to reduce the number of false positives and produces 
  a fully annotated output for each predicted fusion.
